The Turkish name is mentioned as 𐱅𐰇𐰼𐰰 Yiwu in the Orkhon Inscriptions. According to Turkish documents, the name Turk (Chinese: 突厥) was first given to the tribe (also known as Aşina) who destroyed the Dwarf Khanate and founded the Gokturk Khanate. It lived as a nomad during the Gokturks time. These nomads lived in Central Asia around the Altai Mountains in northern Mongolia. The Gokturks were ruled from the 6th to the 8th centuries by the Khagans, who were influential in the region between the Aral Sea and the Hindu Kush Mountains, also known as Transoxiana. In the eighth century, some Turkic tribes, including the Oghuzs, went south of the Ceyhun river. Others are claimed to have migrated west to the northern shores of the Black Sea.
The name Turk spread as a political title given to Turkish or non-Turkish people who were under Gokturk rule. This name was given to most Turkic-speaking tribes in Central Asia by the Muslim people who later made contact with the Turks.
However, the word Turk is in Chinese sources; It is thought to be used as 丁零 (Pinyin: dīng líng), 丁霊 (dīng líng), 敕勒 (chì lè), 鉄勒 (tiě lè).
In the 10th century Uyghur texts, Turk is used to mean "power, strength". However, this usage, which belongs to two centuries after the dissolution of the Göktürk Khanate, is highly likely to have a political/historical reference.
